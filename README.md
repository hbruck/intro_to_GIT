first repro, with Marine Data Science in R

you can edit it after cloning to the computer, push it to the internet after typing in R and saving...

-blue M next to path means that it was modified recently (the version on my harddrive is different than the file on github)
-yellow ? means that the file is not being tracked
-click checked box under Staged
